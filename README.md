## üèó Architecture Overview

The AI Scrum Master uses a **modular AI pipeline**:

1. **Frontend**  
   - React (TypeScript) dashboard for sprint status, backlog suggestions, reports.  
   - Chatbot interface inside Slack/Teams.

2. **Backend**  
   - Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express/NestJS)  
   - Orchestrates workflows, integrates APIs, and calls LLM services.

3. **AI Engine**  
   - OpenAI GPT-4 / GPT-3.5 via API (or Llama 2 for on-prem)  
   - LangChain for prompt orchestration, tool usage, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

4. **Vector Database**  
   - Pinecone / Weaviate / FAISS for semantic search over backlog items, past sprint data, and documentation.

5. **Integrations**  
   - Jira/Trello APIs, GitHub webhooks, Slack SDK, CI/CD events.

6. **Database & Auth**  
   - PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching, and OAuth 2.0 for secure integration tokens.
